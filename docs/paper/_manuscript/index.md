# Abstract

We present Cortext, a biologically-inspired adaptive memory system
governed by three continuous control parameters: Focus (F), Sensitivity
(S), and Stability (T). Unlike traditional memory architectures that
employ discrete operational modes, Cortext achieves developmental
progression through parameter-derived rate modulation, allowing behavior
to emerge continuously from the interaction of knob settings and
experiential mass. The architecture integrates established cognitive
science principles—including Cowan’s working memory constraints and
Nader’s reconsolidation dynamics—into a unified computational framework.
We derive most system parameters from the three primary knobs through
principled mathematical transformations, while explicitly labeling the
small set of fixed invariants (e.g., controller gains), reducing
reliance on hard-coded constants. The system demonstrates
self-calibrating priors that blend with evidence using
uncertainty-weighted Bayesian averaging, homeostatic threshold control
with effective sample size estimation, and graph-augmented retrieval
combining embedding similarity with semantic extraction. Experimental
analysis indicates the architecture maintains stable operation across
developmental phases while adapting write rates, decay dynamics, and
retrieval precision to environmental demands. This work contributes a
formally specified cognitive memory model suitable for implementation in
streaming AI systems requiring persistent, context-aware memory.

# Introduction

Memory systems in artificial intelligence face a fundamental tension
between plasticity and stability. Systems that learn rapidly risk
catastrophic interference, while those that maintain stable
representations may fail to capture novel patterns (McCloskey and Cohen
1989). Biological memory systems resolve this tension through
sophisticated regulatory mechanisms that modulate learning rates, decay
dynamics, and retrieval thresholds in response to environmental demands
and internal state (McClelland, McNaughton, and O’Reilly 1995).

This paper introduces Cortext, a cognitive memory architecture that
addresses this stability-plasticity dilemma through three continuous
control parameters that govern all system behavior. Rather than
implementing discrete operational modes or hard-coded phase transitions,
Cortext achieves developmental progression through the continuous
interaction of parameter settings with accumulated experience. The
architecture draws on established findings from cognitive psychology and
neuroscience, including working memory capacity limits (Cowan 2001),
memory reconsolidation (Nader, Schafe, and Le Doux 2000), serial
position effects (Murdock Jr 1962), and emotional modulation of memory
(McGaugh 2004).

The core contribution of this work is a formally specified memory
architecture in which:

1.  Most tuneable parameters derive from three primary knobs (Focus,
    Sensitivity, Stability) through explicit mathematical
    transformations, while fixed invariants (e.g., controller gains) are
    labeled and justified.
2.  System priors self-calibrate through uncertainty-weighted Bayesian
    blending with observed evidence.
3.  Developmental phases emerge from annealed safety bounds and
    experiential mass accumulation, not explicit mode switching.
4.  A knowledge graph layer enables semantic consolidation and
    graph-augmented retrieval.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews
relevant literature. Section 3 presents the mathematical foundations
including notation, helper functions, and knob-derived parameters.
Section 4 details the core algorithms for Focus, Sensitivity, and
Stability adaptation. Section 5 describes structural metrics and
composite scoring. Section 6 covers dynamic thresholding and homeostatic
control. Section 7 presents the reinforcement and decay dynamics.
Section 8 describes advanced cognitive processes including working
memory, metacognition, and emotional consolidation. Section 9 details
the consolidation and graph integration system. Section 10 presents the
interrupt gate for streaming integration. Section 11 reports preliminary
experimental results. Section 12 discusses implementation considerations
and computational complexity. Section 13 concludes with limitations and
future directions.

## Working Memory Models

The working memory component of Cortext draws primarily on Cowan (2001)
embedded-processes model, which posits a capacity limit of approximately
4±1 chunks for the focus of attention. This contrasts with Miller (1956)
earlier estimate of 7±2 items, which subsequent research has shown
conflates chunking with raw capacity (Cowan 2010). Our implementation
respects these empirically-derived constraints while allowing for
focus-dependent modulation within bounded ranges.

Baddeley (2000) multicomponent model informs our treatment of
maintenance and rehearsal processes, though we adopt a more unified
representational substrate based on distributed embeddings rather than
separate phonological and visuospatial stores. The episodic buffer
concept (Baddeley 2000) aligns with our approach to binding information
across modalities through shared vector spaces.

## Memory Consolidation

The consolidation mechanisms in Cortext reflect findings from the memory
reconsolidation literature (Nader, Schafe, and Le Doux 2000; Nader
2003). Reconsolidation theory posits that retrieved memories enter a
labile state during which they can be modified before restabilization.
Our architecture implements this through time-bounded lability windows
governed by the Stability parameter, with reconsolidation gain modulated
by both Sensitivity and contextual relevance.

The distinction between episodic and semantic memory (Tulving 1972)
motivates our two-tier storage approach: a streaming episodic buffer for
immediate experiences and a consolidated semantic graph for abstracted
knowledge. The consolidation process transforms high-redundancy episodic
clusters into summary nodes linked by typed semantic relations,
consistent with complementary learning systems theory (McClelland,
McNaughton, and O’Reilly 1995).

## Emotional Influences on Memory

McGaugh (2004) extensive work on emotional modulation of memory
consolidation informs our treatment of affect-gated encoding. The
architecture implements emotional intensity as a threshold modifier,
consistent with findings that arousal enhances memory through
amygdala-mediated modulation of hippocampal encoding (LaBar and Cabeza
2006). We adopt a dimensional model of emotion (Russell 1980) with
valence and arousal as primary axes, projected from categorical emotion
embeddings.

## Adaptive Control Systems

The homeostatic threshold controller draws on classical control theory,
specifically proportional-integral approaches to setpoint maintenance
(Åström and Murray 2008). The use of exponentially-weighted moving
averages for rate estimation follows standard practice in adaptive
systems, while our effective sample size calculation for reliability
estimation extends techniques from sequential Monte Carlo methods (Liu
and Chen 1998).

# Mathematical Foundations

## Notation and Primitives

We establish the following notation used throughout this paper. Let ε(F,
S, T) = 10^(−8 + 2T) denote a small stability-dependent constant for
numerical stability (we write ε as shorthand for ε(F, S, T)). All knob
values F, S, T lie in the closed interval \[0, 1\].

Core mathematical primitives:

    lerp(a, b, x) = a + (b − a) × x
    clamp(v, lo, hi) = max(lo, min(v, hi))
    sigmoid(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(−z))
    EWMA(prev, x, α) = (1 − α) × prev + α × x

Weight normalization and blending for combining multiple signals:

    normalize(w) = w / max(sum(w), ε) # w is a weight vector

Edge case: if sum(w) \< ε, return uniform weights (1/|w|) to avoid
division by zero or invalid probability distributions.

    blend(values, weights) = Σᵢ values[i] × weights[i]

Note: normalize() operates on weight vectors, not scalars. When used
with scalar expressions like lerp(), collect the scalars into a vector
first: normalize(\[lerp(…), lerp(…), …\]). The blend() function assumes
pre-normalized weights summing to 1.

For vectors, we define cosine similarity as cos(u, v) = u·v / (‖u‖ ×
‖v‖), and safe L2 normalization as l2_normalize(v) = v / max(‖v‖, ε).
Shannon entropy is computed in nats: H(p) = −Σᵢ pᵢ ln(pᵢ).

The temporal decay function follows exponential dynamics with
configurable half-life:

    decay(x, τ_half, Δt) = x × exp(−ln(2) × Δt / max(τ_half, τ_min(T)))

where τ_min(T) = lerp(60, 300, T) seconds provides a stability-derived
floor to prevent numerical instability from near-zero half-lives.

### Units Convention

To ensure consistency and avoid unit mismatch errors, the following
conventions apply throughout:

**Input timestamps:** All input timestamps (t) are specified in
milliseconds since epoch, consistent with standard system time APIs.

**Internal time representation:** All internal time calculations operate
in seconds. We define:

    now_s() = system_time_ms / 1000  # returns seconds
    now_ms() = system_time_ms         # returns milliseconds
    to_s(ts_ms) = ts_ms / 1000       # ms → seconds conversion

**Stored timestamps:** All stored timestamps are milliseconds since Unix
epoch.

**Naming contract (canonical):** Use the variable names below
consistently throughout this document. Units: stored timestamps are
integers in milliseconds (commonly suffixed \*\_ts, and also appearing
as timestamp/created_at/last_rate_timestamp); derived time intervals in
seconds use the **s suffix. Accumulator variables: t_start,
last_signal_ts, last_write_ts, drift_acc, eta_acc, coherence_prev,
emo_max, arousal_sum, drift_accum, drift_at_last_interrupt,
drift_acc_pacing, x_last_check. Global variables: signals_processed,
u_uncertainty, mood_vector, last_mood_ts, theta_dynamic, theta_target,
hysteresis, m_rate, rho_hat_prev, dt_ema, rate_ticks, reliability,
last_rate_timestamp, last_retrieval_ts, retention_ema, last_embedding,
x_pred_ema. Weight naming rule: weight** and **weight variables (e.g.,
weight_relevance, mismatch_weight, weight_surprise) are control
parameters; w** variables (e.g., w_relevance, w_mismatch, … w_arousal)
are composite-score blender weights.

**Drift naming note:** `drift_step_t` (also called *drift_increment*) is
the instantaneous per-signal cosine distance between x_t and x\_{t−1}.
`drift_acc` accumulates drift_step_t within the current memory unit for
boundary decisions; `drift_accum` tracks cumulative per-signal embedding
drift used for interrupt refractory pressure. Treat these as distinct
signals.

**Time-index convention:** Per-step computed values use a `_t` suffix
(e.g., score_t, theta_dynamic_t). Retained state uses the bare name
(e.g., theta_dynamic). When a step proposes a new value, compute the
`_t` variant and assign the bare name at end of step (see Appendix D).

**Time deltas:** All Δt values, elapsed times (mem_elapsed, signal_gap,
idle_for), and time comparisons operate in seconds:

    Δt ← now_s() − to_s(last_rate_timestamp)   # seconds
    mem_elapsed ← now_s() − to_s(t_start)     # seconds
    signal_gap ← now_s() − to_s(last_signal_ts)  # seconds

**Time constants:** All time-related constants are specified with
explicit units (e.g., τ_min(T) in seconds). Threshold limits like
max_mem_time(T) and gap_scale(T) return values in seconds (gap_scale
multiplies dt_ema to form gap_ref_s).

### No Fixed Behavioral Constants

All behavioral thresholds, gains, and caps are derived from the three
knobs (F, S, T) and/or state. Fixed numeric values are permitted only
for numerical stability floors (e.g., ε(F, S, T)) and unit conversions.
This keeps the system’s qualitative behavior entirely governed by the
three knobs, consistent with the human-memory objective.

### Buffers

The specification uses distinct streaming buffers:

**signal_stream:** The raw per-signal embedding stream x_t used for
scoring, uncertainty estimation, threshold/rate updates, and accumulator
updates. Any context slices operate on signal_stream.

**score_stream:** The per-signal scalar score stream. At each step,
append score_t to score_stream. Any score lookbacks operate on
score_stream.

**memory_stream:** The stream of written memory representatives (e_rep
for completed units) used for retrieval and focus-spread computations.

**recent_memory_centroids:** A bounded deque of recent memory centroids
(μ_acc) used by the interrupt gate.

    win_mem_ctx(T) = round(lerp(4, 32, T))  # max memories in interrupt context
    On successful write_memory: recent_memory_centroids.append(l2_normalize(μ_acc));
    recent_memory_centroids ← tail(recent_memory_centroids, win_mem_ctx(T))

## The Three-Knob Philosophy

Cortext is governed by three continuous control parameters, each
representing a distinct dimension of cognitive regulation:

**Focus (F ∈ \[0, 1\]):** Perceptual selectivity and precision. Higher
Focus narrows attention, increases relevance weighting, and reduces
retrieval breadth. Focus modulates the trade-off between exploitation of
known-relevant information and exploration of potentially useful
context.

**Sensitivity (S ∈ \[0, 1\]):** Plasticity and affective gain. Higher
Sensitivity accelerates learning, increases emotional and novelty
responsiveness, and raises write-rate targets. Sensitivity governs how
readily the system captures novel information and responds to salient
stimuli.

**Stability (T ∈ \[0, 1\]):** Temporal persistence and inertia. Higher
Stability lengthens memory half-lives, widens hysteresis bands, slows
adaptive updates, and tightens safety bounds over time. Stability
controls the resistance to change and the preservation of established
knowledge.

A central design principle is that knobs set rates rather than modes.
Behavioral differences emerge continuously from parameter interactions;
there are no hard-coded phase transitions or discrete operational
states.

## Knob-Derived Parameters

Most system tunables derive from the three primary knobs. This section
catalogs the key derivations; fixed invariants are explicitly labeled in
their respective sections.

### Context Windows and Temporal Scales

    n_ctx(T) = round(lerp(32, 256, T))
    win_score(T) = round(lerp(20, 120, T))
    win_rate_s(T) = round(lerp(60, 300, T))

The context window n_ctx determines how many recent items inform
relevance computation. The scoring window win_score controls the
lookback for variance estimation and percentile calculation. The rate
window win_rate_s specifies the temporal horizon (in seconds) for
write-rate measurement.

### Half-Life and Decay

Memory half-life follows a log-scale mapping to span multiple orders of
magnitude:

    τ_min = 120.0 seconds (2 minutes)
    τ_max = 43200.0 seconds (12 hours)
    base_half_life(T) = exp(ln(τ_min) + T × ln(τ_max / τ_min))

This exponential mapping ensures that low Stability yields half-lives
near 2 minutes while high Stability approaches 12 hours, with smooth
interpolation across the range.

### Hysteresis and Rate Targets

    band_min = 0.02; band_max = 0.25
    base_band(T) = lerp(band_min, band_max, T)
    r_min = 0.2; r_max = 5.0  (writes per minute)
    base_rate(S) = lerp(r_min, r_max, S)

The hysteresis band prevents oscillation in threshold-crossing
decisions. Write-rate targets establish homeostatic setpoints for the
threshold controller.

These ranges are canonical knob maps; no additional fixed thresholds are
introduced beyond the three knobs.

### Experiential Mass and Maturity

The system tracks accumulated experience through a maturity function
that governs the annealing of safety bounds:

    τ_m(T) = lerp(10.0, 200.0, T)
    maturity(t) = 1 − exp(−count / τ_m(T))

where count is the total number of signals processed. This produces
asymptotic approach to unit maturity, with higher Stability slowing the
progression to reflect greater conservatism.

Safety bounds on the dynamic threshold anneal with maturity:

    T_min(t) = lerp(0.01, 0.05, maturity(t))
    T_max(t) = lerp(0.99, 0.95, maturity(t))
    max_ΔT_per_min(t) = lerp(0.30, 0.10, maturity(t))

Early operation permits wide threshold excursions; mature operation
constrains movement to a narrower band.

## Uncertainty Estimation

Uncertainty u(t) ∈ \[0, 1\] modulates learning rates and evidence
weighting. The raw uncertainty estimate blends multiple signals:

    var_score_max(S) = lerp(0.15, 0.35, S)
    recent_scores ← tail(score_stream, win_score(T))
    if |recent_scores| < 2:
        var_recent_norm ← 0
    else:
        var_recent_norm ← clamp(var(recent_scores) / var_score_max, 0, 1)
    coherence_complement = 1 − coherence_struct_t  # uses structural coherence

When prediction error signals are available, novelty and surprisal are
blended:

    novelty_surprise = blend([novelty_t, surprisal_t],
                            weights = normalize([S, 1 − T]))

The final raw uncertainty combines these components with knob-derived
weights:

Normative note (MUST): focus_spread_t is the per-step derived
focus-spread metric from
<a href="#sec-focus-spread" class="quarto-xref">Section 5.1.2</a> and is
available each step when computing u(t).

    weights_u = normalize([S, F, 1 − T, S × (1 − T)])
    u_raw(t) = clamp(blend([var_recent_norm, focus_spread_t,
                            coherence_complement, novelty_surprise],
                           weights = weights_u), 0, 1)

Smoothed uncertainty applies EWMA with a stability-dependent rate:

    α_u(T) = 0.10 + (1 − T) × 0.60
    u(t) = EWMA(u(t−1), u_raw(t), α = α_u(T))

When structural metrics are unavailable, the fallback is u_raw(t) = 1 −
maturity(t), ensuring high uncertainty during early operation.

# Core Adaptation Algorithms

This section presents the algorithms governing adaptation along each of
the three primary dimensions. Each algorithm consists of a prior
computation (executed at initialization) and a dynamic update (executed
per signal).

## Focus-Driven Selectivity

Focus governs perceptual selectivity through relevance weighting and
attention width.

### Focus Priors

Given Focus knob F ∈ \[0, 1\], initialize Focus control variables:

    weight_relevance = sigmoid(2F − 1)
    coverage_gain_floor = 0.3 + 0.7F
    mismatch_weight = 1 − F
    attention_width = lerp(π, 0.1π, F)

The attention width (in radians) controls the angular spread of the
receptive field in embedding space. High Focus produces narrow attention
(0.1π), while low Focus permits broad capture (π).

### Dynamic Focus Update

At each signal event t with input embedding x_t:

    recent_context ← tail(signal_stream, n_ctx(T))
    if |recent_context| == 0:
        μ_ctx ← 0_vector; observed_cosine ← 0  # map01(0)=0.5
    else:
        μ_ctx ← mean(recent_context)
        observed_cosine ← cos(x_t, μ_ctx)
    weight_relevance_t ← EWMA(weight_relevance,
                          map01(observed_cosine), α = α_F(t))

    weight_relevance ← weight_relevance_t

where map01(z) = clamp((z + 1) / 2, 0, 1) transforms cosine values from
\[−1, 1\] to \[0, 1\].

The learning rate α_F(t) is modulated by uncertainty:

    α_min_F = 0.05; α_span_F = 0.45
    α_F(t) = α_min_F + F × α_span_F × u(t)

High uncertainty increases learning rate, allowing faster adaptation
when the environment is volatile. The Focus knob scales the uncertainty
responsiveness.

## Sensitivity-Driven Plasticity

Sensitivity governs learning speed, emotional responsiveness, and
novelty capture.

### Sensitivity Priors

Given Sensitivity knob S ∈ \[0, 1\], initialize Sensitivity control
variables:

    rate_target = base_rate(S)  # writes/min
    weight_novelty = 0.3 + 0.7S
    weight_surprise = 0.2 + 0.8S
    weight_valence = 0.4 + 0.6S
    weight_arousal = S
    emotion_gain = exp(1.5S)
    score_gain = exp(2S)

### Emotional Projection

When emotion category centroids are available, the system projects input
embeddings onto a discrete emotion space C = {anger, fear, joy, love,
sadness, surprise}. categories inspired by Russell (1980) circumplex
model are projected onto the valence-arousal plane:coordinates:

    v_map = {anger: −0.9, fear: −0.8, sadness: −0.9,
             joy: +0.9, love: +0.8, surprise: 0.0}
    a_map = {anger: +0.9, fear: +0.9, sadness: +0.3,
             joy: +0.6, love: +0.5, surprise: +0.8}

The projection procedure:

    raw_cos_c ← cos(x_t, centroids[c]) for each c ∈ C
    if all raw_cos_c ≤ 0:
        p_c ← uniform(1/6)  # ensures downstream mood update is well-defined
        emotion_intensity_t ← 0; valence_t ← 0.5; arousal_t ← 0
    else:
        logits_c ← max(0, raw_cos_c)
        β(S) = 4 + 8S  # softmax inverse temperature
        p_c ← softmax(β(S) × logits_c)
        peak ← max_c(p_c)
        confidence ← 1 − H(p_c) / ln(6)
        emotion_intensity_t ← sqrt(peak × confidence)
        valence_t ← (Σ_c p_c × v_map[c] + 0.9) / 1.8
        arousal_t ← clamp(Σ_c p_c × a_map[c], 0, 1)

The emotion intensity combines peak probability with distributional
confidence via geometric mean, providing a measure that is high only
when a single emotion dominates with high certainty.

### Threshold Modulation from Emotion

Emotional activation loosens write thresholds to capture salient
moments:

    κ_emo ← κ_base × S  # where κ_base = 0.10
    ΔThreshold_emotion_t ← −κ_emo × emotion_intensity_t ×
                            (0.5 + 0.5 × arousal_t)

The emotional state acts as a modulator for memory
encoding/consolidation, following McGaugh (2004). High arousal and
valence magnitude increase the likelihood of threshold crossings.

### Mood Integration

Distinct from instantaneous emotion, the mood state M_t ∈ ℝ⁶ maintains a
persistent background affective tone as a 6-dimensional vector (one
component per emotion category from <a href="#sec-emotional-projection"
class="quarto-xref">Section 4.2.2</a>):

    α_mood(S) = lerp(0.01, 0.20, S)  # reactivity
    half_life_mood(T) = lerp(30, 600, T)  # seconds
    Δt_mood ← now_s() − to_s(last_mood_ts)
    λ_mood(Δt_mood, T) ← exp(−ln(2) × Δt_mood / max(half_life_mood(T), ε))
    e_t ← p_c − (1/6)  # centered 6D vector (can be negative)
    M_t = λ_mood(Δt_mood, T) × M_{t−1} + α_mood(S) × e_t
    M_t ← clamp_elementwise(M_t, −1.0, 1.0)  # per-component
    last_mood_ts ← now_ms()  # update timestamp after mood update (ms)

Note: when all raw_cos_c ≤ 0, p_c is uniform and e_t = 0, so mood only
decays. Because e_t is centered around zero, M_t can have both positive
and negative components, reflecting sustained elevation or suppression
relative to baseline. The mood state provides a separate threshold bias
via its normalized magnitude:

    κ_mood ← κ_base × S
    m_norm ← ‖M_t‖ / √6  # max norm when all components at 1
    ΔThreshold_mood_t ← −κ_mood × clamp(m_norm, 0, 1)

## Stability-Driven Persistence

Stability governs temporal dynamics through half-life, decay rates, and
hysteresis.

### Stability Priors

Given Stability knob T ∈ \[0, 1\], initialize Stability control
variables:

    hysteresis = lerp(0.02, 0.25, T)
    half_life = base_half_life(T)
    rate_decay = lerp(0.60, 0.98, T)
    periphery_half_life = clamp(0.5 × half_life,
                                       τ_min, τ_max)
    drift_weight = 0.5 × (1 − T)

### Dynamic Stability Update

The stability update uses uncertainty-modulated learning rate and a
stability-derived retention window:

    α_min_T = 0.02; α_span_T = 0.18
    α_T(t) = α_min_T + (1 − T) × α_span_T × u(t)
    win_ret(T) = round(lerp(10, 50, T))  # retention history window size

At each signal event, compute retention statistics and adjust half-life:

    active_memories ← {m | strength(m) ≥ periphery_cutoff(T)}
    observed_retention ← mean_age(active_memories)
    retention_ema_t ← EWMA(retention_ema_{t−1},
                           observed_retention, α = α_T(t))

    retention_ema ← retention_ema_t

Definitions:

    age_s(m) ← now_s() − to_s(m.created_at)  # fallback: use start_ts if created_at unset
    mean_age(active_memories) ← mean_{m ∈ active_memories} age_s(m); if empty, return 0
    retention_history ← append(observed_retention); keep last win_ret(T) values

Compute z-score relative to recent retention history:

    last_win_ret ← tail(retention_history, win_ret(T))
    μ_ret ← mean(last_win_ret)
    σ_ret ← max(std(last_win_ret), 1.0)
    zscore_ret ← clamp((observed_retention − μ_ret) / σ_ret, −3, +3)

The target half-life incorporates feedback adjustment from the stability
feedback mechanism
(<a href="#sec-feedback" class="quarto-xref">Section 7.4</a>):

    stability_adj ← ΔHalfLife_adj_t if provided else 0
    target_half_life_t ← clamp(base_half_life(T) ×
                              (1 + 0.25 × zscore_ret + stability_adj),
                              τ_min, τ_max)
    half_life_t ← EWMA(half_life_{t−1}, target_half_life_t,
                       α = α_T(t))

    half_life ← half_life_t

# Structural Metrics and Composite Scoring

Context definitions (used throughout Table 1 and structural metrics):

    recent_context ← tail(signal_stream, n_ctx(T))
    if |recent_context| == 0:
        μ_ctx ← 0_vector  # define cos(x_t, μ_ctx)=0 so map01(cos)=0.5
    else:
        μ_ctx ← mean(recent_context)

## Embedding-Derived Metrics

### Structural Coherence

Structural coherence (coherence_struct) measures integration of the
current signal with the broader context window. This metric is distinct
from memory coherence (coherence_mem, defined in
<a href="#sec-drift-coherence" class="quarto-xref">Section 6.4.2</a>)
which tracks within-memory similarity:

    coh_neutral(T) = lerp(0.45, 0.55, T)
    if |recent_context| < 2:
        coherence_struct_t ← coh_neutral(T)  # neutral, stability-derived
    else:
        raw ← var([cos(x_t, c) for c in recent_context])
        coherence_struct_t ← 1 − clamp(raw, 0, 1)  # range [0, 1]

High structural coherence (low variance in similarities) indicates the
signal fits consistently with context. The effective Focus is modulated:
F_eff = F × (0.5 + 0.5 × coherence_struct_t).

**Effective Focus usage:** F_eff is a diagnostic modulation of Focus.
Unless a formula explicitly references F_eff, the specification uses raw
F (including all Table 1 metric formulas and knob-derived controls).

### Focus Spread

Focus spread quantifies the entropy of attention over nearest neighbors:

    k ← k_neighbors(T) = round(lerp(8, 32, T))

Normative note (MUST): kNN_similarities MUST be computed by querying
memory_stream with q = x_t and k = k_neighbors(T) (not recent_context).

    if |memory_stream| == 0:
        focus_spread_t ← 0  # cold-start fallback
    else:
        k_eff ← min(k, |memory_stream|)
        if k_eff < 2:
            focus_spread_t ← 0  # avoid degenerate entropy
        else:
            kNN_similarities ← topK(vector_search(x_t, k=k_eff))
            # attention_width sharpens or flattens similarities
            kNN_similarities ← clamp(kNN_similarities × (π / attention_width), −1, 1)
            p ← softmax(kNN_similarities)
            focus_spread_t ← H(p) / ln(k_eff)

Values near 1 indicate diffuse attention; values near 0 indicate
concentrated attention. The effective Focus is further modulated: F_eff
← F_eff × (1 − focus_spread_t).

### Instantaneous Drift

Drift measures the instantaneous step between consecutive signals rather
than a smoothed centroid lag:

    if x_{t−1} is unset:
        drift_step_t ← 0
    else:
        drift_step_t ← cosine_dist(x_t, x_{t−1})  # 1 − cos(·), range [0, 2]
    drift_mag_t ← drift_step_t

This uses the current signal velocity in embedding space, ensuring drift
responds immediately to context shifts. A threshold defines an
informational drift-boundary signal:

    drift_threshold ← lerp(0.10, 0.35, T)
    drift_boundary_t ← (drift_mag_t > drift_threshold)

Normative note (MUST): drift_boundary_t is informational and MUST NOT
trigger a memory flush on its own. Memory flush decisions are defined by
should_flush in
<a href="#sec-boundary" class="quarto-xref">Section 6.4.3</a>.

The instantaneous drift_step_t also informs boundary pressure and
focus-width feedback.

### Real-Time Prediction Error (EMA)

We model real-time expectation using an exponential moving average (EMA)
of the signal stream. The predictor state `x_pred_ema` represents the
current expectation; low Stability (T) adapts quickly, high Stability
adapts slowly.

We treat orthogonal or anti-correlated vectors (cos ≤ 0) as maximum
surprise.

    β_pred(T) = lerp(0.25, 0.02, T)
    err_ref(S) = lerp(0.25, 0.05, S)
    k_surprise(S,T) = lerp(6, 14, S) × lerp(1.1, 0.9, T)

    if x_pred_ema is unset:
        x_pred_ema ← x_t  # initialize expectation
        surprisal_t ← 0
    else:
        prediction_error_t ← 1 − max(0, cos(x_t, x_pred_ema))
        surprisal_t ← sigmoid((prediction_error_t − err_ref(S)) * k_surprise(S,T))
        x_pred_ema ← l2_normalize((1 − β_pred(T)) × x_pred_ema +
                                   β_pred(T) × x_t)

This formulation captures prediction failure directly from the stream,
without requiring an explicit kinematic trend model.

## Composite Score Computation

## Metric Weight Blending

Metric weights adapt online using recursive least squares (RLS) to
minimize prediction error between composite scores and observed
outcomes. Initial weights derive from bootstrap coefficients:

Blender weights are maintained as variables w\_\* (do not confuse these
with control weights like weight_relevance or mismatch_weight). We
denote the 12-element blender weight vector as:

    W_blend = [w_relevance, w_mismatch, w_surprise, w_rarity, w_drift,
              w_utility, w_salience, w_valence, w_arousal, w_contradiction,
              w_periphery, w_coverage]

The index i used below (e.g., w_bootstrap\[i\], w_rls\[i\]) follows this
ordering.

    w_bootstrap[i] ← sigmoid(c_F[i]×F + c_S[i]×S + c_T[i]×T + d_i)

Before normalization, control weights modulate the blender weights:

    w_relevance ← w_relevance × weight_relevance
    w_mismatch  ← w_mismatch  × mismatch_weight
    w_surprise  ← w_surprise  × weight_surprise
    w_valence   ← w_valence   × weight_valence × emotion_gain
    w_arousal   ← w_arousal   × weight_arousal × emotion_gain
    w_coverage  ← w_coverage  × coverage_gain_floor

Composite score scaling applies after weight normalization:

    score_t ← clamp(score_raw × score_gain, 0, 1)

Bootstrap coefficient defaults (canonical; used for initialization):

These coefficients define a canonical initialization map from the three
knobs; they do not introduce additional runtime thresholds and may be
refit from human data without changing the rest of the system.

### RLS Weight Adaptation (Canonical)

RLS fits the blender weights directly in **weight-space**, using the
current metrics as predictors and an observed outcome signal as the
target. State is retained as a weight vector `w` and covariance matrix
`P`.

Target and predictor:

    x_t ← [metric_i] (each metric clamped to [0,1])
    y_t ← relevance_t  # observed outcome (in [0,1])

Update cadence and forgetting:

    k_update = round(lerp(1, 8, T))  # update every k_update signals
    λ(T) = 0.90 + 0.09T              # forgetting factor

RLS update (performed when step % k_update == 0):

    y_hat ← wᵀ x_t
    e_t ← y_t − y_hat
    K ← (P x_t) / (λ + x_tᵀ P x_t)
    w ← clamp(w + K × e_t, 0, 1)
    P ← (I − K x_tᵀ) P / λ

Note: RLS fits **unnormalized** weights `w`; normalization happens later
in composite score computation.

Initialization:

    w_0 ← w_bootstrap   # from the coefficient table above
    P_init(T) = lerp(500, 2000, 1 − T)
    P_0 ← diag(P_init(T))

Interpretation-only window size:

    N ← round(lerp(64, 512, T))  # effective fitting window (interpretation only)

The fitted weights blend with bootstrap weights based on RLS confidence:

    τ_rls ← lerp(20.0, 80.0, T)
    t ← signals_processed  # global step count (maturity)
    confidence_rls ← 1 − exp(−t / τ_rls)
    w_rls01[i] ← clamp(w[i], 0, 1)  # constrain fitted weights to mixture range
    weight_i(t) ← clamp((1 − confidence_rls) × w_bootstrap[i] +
                          confidence_rls × w_rls01[i], 0, 1)

### Score Normalization

Composite score computation requires careful normalization:

    for each metric i:
        m01[i] = clamp(metric[i], 0, 1)
    weight_sum ← Σ weights[i]
    if weight_sum < ε: return 0
    weights_norm[i] ← weights[i] / weight_sum
    score ← clamp(Σ weights_norm[i] × m01[i], 0, 1)

Invariant (MUST): all 12 Table 1 metric values are defined on \[0, 1\].

Weight normalization is critical: with 12 metrics and raw weights
averaging ~0.6, the sum approaches 7.2. Without normalization, weighted
sums would saturate and collapse variance.

# Dynamic Thresholding and Homeostatic Control

The write gate compares composite scores against an adaptive threshold
θ_dynamic (written as theta_dynamic when referring to the recorded
variable). This section details the threshold evolution algorithm
incorporating Bayesian prior-evidence blending and homeostatic rate
control.

## Prior-Evidence Blending

The threshold prior derives from knob settings:

    θ_prior(F, S, T) = lerp(0.10, 0.30, T) × (1 − 0.3S)

Observed evidence comes from the 90th percentile of recent scores:

    recent_scores ← tail(score_stream, win_score(T))
    if |recent_scores| == 0:
        observed_p90 ← θ_prior  # no evidence yet
    else:
        observed_p90 ← percentile(recent_scores, 90)

Prior and evidence masses weight the blend:

    ρ_prior ← prior_mass(T) = round(lerp(2, 32, T))
    ρ_obs ← u(t) × |recent_scores|

The target threshold blends prior and evidence:

    θ_target ← (ρ_prior × θ_prior + ρ_obs × observed_p90) /
                max(ε, ρ_prior + ρ_obs)

High Stability increases prior mass, making the system more resistant to
observed deviations. High uncertainty increases evidence mass, allowing
faster adaptation to volatile conditions.

## Homeostatic Rate Control

The controller maintains write rates near the target setpoint through
continuous-time estimation with effective sample size (ESS) reliability
weighting.

### Rate Estimation

    Δt ← now_s() − to_s(last_rate_timestamp)
    dt_min(T) = 10^(−4 + 2T)  # stability-derived minimum Δt (seconds)
    Δt ← max(Δt, dt_min(T))
    τ_dt(T) = lerp(0.5, 2.0, T)
    α_dt ← 1 − exp(−Δt / τ_dt(T))
    dt_ema ← (1 − α_dt) × dt_ema + α_dt × Δt
    dt_floor(T) = lerp(0.1, 0.5, T)  # stability-derived minimum cadence
    dt_base ← max(dt_ema, dt_floor(T))

The rate time constant scales with Stability:

    τ_rate ← max(2^(3T) × dt_base, dt_floor(T))
    α ← 1 − exp(−Δt / τ_rate)

Instantaneous rate estimation with bias correction. Δwrites is the
binary indicator (0 or 1) of whether a write occurred during the current
timestep:

    Δwrites ← 1 if write_memory else 0  # binary write event

Normative note (MUST): Δwrites is computed from the current step’s
write_memory decision. Rate state updates occur after the write decision
and affect subsequent timesteps.

    ρ_inst ← (Δwrites / Δt) × 60  # writes per minute
    m_rate_t ← (1 − α) × m_rate + α × ρ_inst
    denom ← max(1 − (1 − α)^(rate_ticks + 1), ε)
    ρ_hat_t ← m_rate_t / denom  # bias-corrected estimate for next step
    m_rate ← m_rate_t
    rho_hat_prev ← ρ_hat_t
    rate_ticks ← rate_ticks + 1
    last_rate_timestamp ← now_ms()  # update after rate computation

### Effective Sample Size

ESS estimates the effective number of independent samples in the EMA,
using a heuristic inspired by Liu and Chen (1998):

    β ← max(0, 1 − α)
    ESS_cap(T) = lerp(30, 120, T)
    ESS ← min((1 + β) / max(1 − β, ε), ESS_cap(T))
    reliability ← 1 − exp(−ESS × (1 − T))

High Stability dampens reliability, preventing aggressive corrections in
conservative regimes.

### Homeostatic Correction

The rate error drives threshold adjustment. The κ\_\* gains are derived
from the knobs to avoid fixed behavioral constants:

Normative note (MUST): rho_hat_prev is stored state entering the
timestep. After the write decision, the rate-state update computes
ρ_hat_t; the assignment rho_hat_prev ← ρ_hat_t occurs at end of step
(see Appendix D).

    rate_error ← tanh((rho_hat_prev − rate_target) /
                      max(rate_target, ε))
    κ_r(F,S,T) = lerp(0.06, 0.14, S) × lerp(1.1, 0.9, T)
    cap_homeo(F,S,T) = lerp(0.35, 0.15, T) × lerp(0.8, 1.2, S) × hysteresis
    Δθ_homeo ← clamp(reliability × κ_r(F,S,T) × (1 − T) ×
                      (1 − maturity(t)) × rate_error,
                      −cap_homeo(F,S,T), +cap_homeo(F,S,T))

The correction scales with reliability and is attenuated by both
Stability and maturity, ensuring conservative, mature systems make
minimal homeostatic adjustments.

### Sensitivity-Based Threshold Adjustment

Sensitivity modulates threshold based on recent score volatility:

    recent_scores ← tail(score_stream, win_score(T))
    if |recent_scores| < 2:
        σ_scores ← 0
    else:
        σ_scores ← std(recent_scores)
    κ_sens(F,S,T) = lerp(0.04, 0.12, S) × lerp(1.1, 0.9, T)
    cap_sens(F,S,T) = lerp(0.30, 0.10, T) × lerp(0.9, 1.1, S) × hysteresis
    σ_ref(S,T) = lerp(0.08, 0.14, S) × lerp(1.1, 0.9, T)
    Δθ_sens ← clamp(−κ_sens(F,S,T) × S × (σ_scores − σ_ref(S,T)),
                    −cap_sens(F,S,T), +cap_sens(F,S,T))

High score variance with high Sensitivity lowers threshold, capturing
more volatile signals.

### Precision-Based Threshold Adjustment

Focus-driven precision tightens threshold when structural coherence is
high:

    κ_prec(F,S,T) = lerp(0.04, 0.10, F) × lerp(1.1, 0.9, T)
    cap_prec(F,S,T) = lerp(0.25, 0.08, T) × lerp(0.9, 1.1, F) × hysteresis
    Δθ_prec ← clamp(κ_prec(F,S,T) × F × (coherence_struct_t − 0.5),
                    −cap_prec(F,S,T), +cap_prec(F,S,T))

High structural coherence with high Focus raises threshold, enforcing
stricter relevance filtering.

## Threshold Integration

All threshold deltas combine and pass through safety limiting. The
emotion and mood deltas from
<a href="#sec-emotional-threshold" class="quarto-xref">Section 4.2.3</a>
and <a href="#sec-mood" class="quarto-xref">Section 4.2.4</a> are
denoted Δθ_emo = ΔThreshold_emotion_t and Δθ_mood = ΔThreshold_mood_t:

    Δθ_total ← Δθ_sens + Δθ_homeo + Δθ_prec + Δθ_emo + Δθ_mood
    cap_total ← max_ΔT_per_min(t) × (Δt / 60.0)
    Δθ_limited ← clamp(Δθ_total, −cap_total, +cap_total)
    θ_dynamic_t ← clamp(EWMA(θ_dynamic_{t−1}, θ_target,
                            α = α_T(t)) + Δθ_limited,
                        T_min(t), T_max(t))
    theta_dynamic ← θ_dynamic_t

Hysteresis evolves toward the stability-derived base:

    hysteresis_t ← clamp(EWMA(hysteresis,
                         base_band(T), α = α_T(t)),
                    band_min, band_max)
    hysteresis ← hysteresis_t

## Write Pacing and Memory Accumulation

The write gate operates per-signal, but coherent “thoughts” often span
multiple signals. This section introduces memory-level accumulation that
groups signals into natural units before storage decisions, inspired by
Event Segmentation Theory (Zacks & Swallow, 2007).

This approach draws from EM-LLM (Fountas et al., 2024), which segments
token sequences into episodic events using surprise-based boundary
detection refined by graph-theoretic cohesion metrics. Their work shows
that combining prediction error signals with within-segment coherence
produces boundaries strongly correlated with human event perception. Our
adaptation uses EMA prediction error (surprisal_t) for surprise and
cosine similarity for cohesion, while drift provides auxiliary boundary
pressure, enabling modality-agnostic operation across text tokens, audio
chunks, video frames, or any signal stream.

### Memory Accumulator State

Each source stream maintains accumulator state:

    μ_acc ← 256d running mean embedding
    drift_acc ← accumulated drift within memory
    s_sum ← sum of signal scores in memory
    s_max ← max signal score in memory
    n ← count of signals in memory
    e_peak ← embedding of highest-scoring signal
    emo_max ← 0  # max emotion_intensity_t within the unit
    arousal_sum ← 0  # sum of arousal_t within the unit (for avg)
    t_start ← now_ms()  # timestamp of accumulation start (ms since epoch)
    last_signal_ts ← now_ms()  # timestamp of previous signal (ms, for gap detection)
    last_write_ts ← 0  # ms; 0 means "no prior write" for refractory
    eta_acc ← 0  # drift EWMA state
    coherence_prev ← 0  # previous coherence (initialize to 0)
    acc_signals_window ← []  # ring buffer of recent embeddings for coherence

Reset behavior: reset_accumulator() clears μ_acc, drift_acc, s_sum,
s_max, n, e_peak, emo_max, arousal_sum, eta_acc, coherence_prev, and
sets acc_signals_window ← \[\] (and refreshes t_start/last_signal_ts for
the next unit), but retains last_write_ts so the refractory term remains
well-defined across boundaries.

    reset_accumulator(): acc_signals_window ← []  # MUST clear coherence window at boundaries

On each signal, update running statistics (note: n is the count before
this signal):

    signal_gap_s ← now_s() − to_s(last_signal_ts)  # compute BEFORE updating last_signal_ts

    win_coh(T) = round(lerp(8, 32, T))  # coherence window size
    acc_signals_window ← tail(acc_signals_window, win_coh(T))

    μ_acc ← (n × μ_acc + x_t) / (n + 1)
    n ← n + 1
    drift_acc ← drift_acc + (drift_mag_t / 2)  # accumulate normalized instantaneous drift (drift_mag_t ∈ [0,2])
    s_sum ← s_sum + score_t
    emo_max ← max(emo_max, emotion_intensity_t)
    arousal_sum ← arousal_sum + arousal_t
    if score_t > s_max:
        s_max ← score_t; e_peak ← x_t
    last_signal_ts ← now_ms()  # update timestamp for next gap calculation (ms)

### Hybrid Drift and Coherence Tracking

Boundary detection combines instantaneous drift with within-memory
coherence tied to the evolving centroid μ_acc:

    ε_noise(T) = lerp(0.01, 0.05, 1 − T)  # stability-derived noise floor
    # Use instantaneous drift_step_t for boundary velocity
    d_step ← max(drift_step_t − ε_noise(T), 0)
    eta_prev ← eta_acc  # baseline before updating EWMA

Memory coherence tracks similarity within the current memory
accumulation window (range \[−1, 1\] from mean cosine):

    mu_curr ← μ_acc  # current accumulator centroid
    current_window ← acc_signals_window  # embeddings from the current unit before mu_curr
    if |current_window| == 0:
        coherence_curr ← 1.0  # empty-window fallback
    else:
        coherence_curr ← mean([cos(mu_curr, x_i) for x_i in current_window])
    # After computing coherence_curr, append mu_curr for the next step
    acc_signals_window.append(mu_curr); acc_signals_window ← tail(acc_signals_window, win_coh(T))
    # coherence_prev is the stored coherence value from the previous step

Note: coherence_mem is distinct from coherence_struct
(<a href="#sec-struct-coherence" class="quarto-xref">Section 5.1.1</a>).
The former tracks within-memory similarity using raw mean cosine, while
the latter measures variance-based integration with broader context.
This dual-signal approach mirrors EM-LLM’s boundary detection mechanism.
In their formulation, boundaries occur where surprise (token-level
prediction error) exceeds a threshold and segment cohesion drops. In
Cortext, surprisal_t provides the prediction-error signal, while drift
spike provides auxiliary boundary pressure and coherence_mem drop
captures within-memory similarity degradation.

### Natural Boundary Detection

Boundary score combines drift spike and coherence drop:

    weight_drift_component = lerp(0.6, 0.4, T)  # weight on drift
    weight_gap_component = lerp(0.05, 0.20, T)  # soft gap influence (low weight)
    weight_drift_component = weight_drift_component × (1 − weight_gap_component)
    weight_coh_component = 1 − weight_gap_component − weight_drift_component
    ε0(T) = lerp(0.005, 0.02, 1 − T)  # cold-start guard for eta_prev
    if eta_prev < ε0(T):
        drift_spike ← 0
    else:
        drift_spike ← (d_step − eta_prev) / max(eta_prev, ε)
    eta_acc ← EWMA(eta_prev, d_step, α = lerp(0.3, 0.1, T))
    coh_drop01 ← clamp((coherence_prev − coherence_curr) / 2, 0, 1)
    coherence_prev ← coherence_curr  # update for next step

    # Adaptive gap signal (dynamic, not a hard trigger)
    dt_ref ← max(dt_ema, dt_floor(T))  # EWMA of inter-arrival Δt in seconds (robust to jitter)
    gap_scale(T) = lerp(3.0, 8.0, T)  # expected pause multiplier
    gap_ref_s ← gap_scale(T) × dt_ref
    gap_z ← (signal_gap_s − gap_ref_s) / max(gap_ref_s, ε)
    gap_score ← sigmoid(gap_z)

    boundary_score ← weight_drift_component × sigmoid(drift_spike) +
                      weight_coh_component × coh_drop01 +
                      weight_gap_component × gap_score
    boundary_score ← clamp(boundary_score, 0, 1)

Boundary threshold and limits:

    b_thresh(F, S) = lerp(0.48, 0.66, F) × lerp(1.1, 0.9, S)
    max_mem_time(T) = lerp(30, 120, T)  # seconds
    max_mem_drift(S) = lerp(0.8, 2.0, S)  # cumulative drift cap

Pressure-capacity ratio (continuous flush trigger derived from knobs):

    capacity_scale(T) = (1 + T)^2  # higher stability = larger capacity
    capacity ← max_mem_drift(S) × capacity_scale(T)
    pressure ← drift_acc × (1 + S)
    saturation_ratio ← pressure / max(capacity, ε)
    k_flush(S,T) = k_surprise(S,T)
    pressure_score ← sigmoid((saturation_ratio − 1) × k_flush(S,T))

Trigger memory flush when:

    mem_elapsed ← now_s() − to_s(t_start)
    should_flush = (boundary_score > b_thresh(F, S)) OR
                   (mem_elapsed > max_mem_time(T)) OR
                   (pressure_score > b_thresh(F, S))

where signal_gap_s = now_s() − to_s(last_signal_ts) is computed at the
start of signal processing (before last_signal_ts is updated). Gap
timing influences boundary_score via gap_score rather than forcing an
unconditional flush, which avoids splitting mid-thought when upstream
processing introduces non-deterministic latency.

### Spike Bypass (Flashbulb Flush)

High-salience signals bypass accumulation and flush immediately,
capturing preceding context as a coherent memory unit:

    spike_margin(S,T) = lerp(0.2, 0.5, T) × lerp(1.2, 0.8, S)  # above θ_dynamic
    mem_tau(T) = win_mem_ctx(T)
    mem_maturity ← 1 − exp(−n / max(mem_tau(T), 1))  # n = signals in current unit
    coherence_scale ← 1 + (1 − T) × clamp(coherence_t, 0, 1)
    spike_margin_eff ← spike_margin(S,T) × (1 + (1 − mem_maturity)) × coherence_scale
    spike_bypass = score_t > (θ_dynamic + spike_margin_eff)
    force_write ← false

When spike_bypass triggers:

    if spike_bypass:
        should_flush = true   # force a boundary
        force_write = true   # bypass S_window > θ_memory

This keeps flashbulb moments intact while preventing early or highly
coherent windows from fragmenting into micro-memories. As the unit
matures, spike bypass becomes easier, and low coherence reduces the
effective margin.

### Window Score and Refractory

Memory-level score combines peak and average with coverage bonus:

    s_avg ← s_sum / max(n, 1)
    α(F) = lerp(0.3, 0.7, F)  # peak vs avg weight
    coverage ← min(n / n_ctx(T), 1.0)  # memory completeness
    β(S) = lerp(0.05, 0.15, S)  # coverage weight
    S_window ← α(F) × s_max + (1 − α(F)) × s_avg + β(S) × coverage

Write refractory suppresses rapid successive writes:

    τ_write_refrac(T) = lerp(5, 30, T)  # seconds
    k_write_refrac = lerp(0.3, 0.1, T)
    Δt_write ← now_s() − to_s(last_write_ts)
    M_write_refrac ← 1.0 + k_write_refrac × exp(−Δt_write / τ_write_refrac(T))

Final write decision:

    θ_memory ← θ_dynamic × M_write_refrac
    write_memory = force_write OR (should_flush AND (S_window > θ_memory))
    if write_memory: last_write_ts ← now_ms()  # update refractory timestamp (ms)

Normative rule (MUST): if should_flush is true, the current unit must be
finalized. If write_memory is false, discard the unit and
reset_accumulator() anyway (do not update last_write_ts). This prevents
perpetual should_flush states (time cap / drift cap / gap cap) while
never resetting.

Trace note: if a run trace reports both write_decision and stored,
interpret write_decision as the boolean gate outcome at the boundary
(the write_memory predicate above). Interpret stored as the eventual
recording outcome (after any final safety checks).

Representative embedding blends accumulator mean with peak:

### Representative Embedding

    ρ(F) = lerp(0.3, 0.7, F)  # mean vs peak blend
    e_rep ← l2_normalize(ρ(F) × μ_acc + (1 − ρ(F)) × e_peak)

On write: store e_rep with metadata {n, s_max, s_avg, drift_acc,
mem_elapsed, s_emotion_max=emo_max, s_arousal_avg=arousal_sum / max(n,
1)}. Append e_rep to memory_stream and l2_normalize(μ_acc) to
recent_memory_centroids. Reset accumulator for next unit.

# Reinforcement and Decay Dynamics

## Memory Strength Model

Each memory m maintains a strength value updated through use-frequency
tracking and exponential decay. The update uses a sensitivity-modulated
learning rate and a binary usage indicator:

    α_min_S = 0.05; α_span_S = 0.35
    α_S(t) = α_min_S + S × α_span_S × u(t)
    used_flag(m) = 1 if m was retrieved and used in current step, else 0

    use_frequency_t ← EWMA(use_frequency_{t−1},
                           used_flag(m), α = α_S(t))
    λ_t ← ln(2) / half_life_t
    strength_t ← clamp(strength_{t−1} × exp(−λ_t × Δt) +
                       S × use_frequency_t, 0, 1)

Δt is measured per memory using its last access timestamp:

    Δt(m) ← now_s() − to_s(m.last_access); if last_access is unset, use created_at

Memories falling below the periphery cutoff are candidates for eviction:

    periphery_cutoff(T) = lerp(0.05, 0.25, T)
    if strength_t < periphery_cutoff(T): evict(m)

## Contextual Gain and Per-Memory Stability (Definitions)

Contextual gain is a per-retrieval signal used by multiple feedback
loops:

    contextual_gain_t(m) ← cos(x_t, m.embedding)    # if m was retrieved and used (range [−1, 1])
    contextual_gain_t(m) ← undefined                # otherwise

When undefined, treat contextual_gain_t(m) as 0 in downstream updates.
Persisted per-memory gain is tracked as a smoothed value:

    L_cg = round(lerp(8, 32, T))
    α_cg = 2 / (L_cg + 1)
    contextual_gain(m) ← EWMA(contextual_gain(m), contextual_gain_t(m), α_cg)

Per-memory stability initializes at creation and is bounded:

    stability(m)_init = 1.0
    stability(m) ← clamp(stability(m), 0.0, 2.0)

Retrieved vs used:

    retrieved(m) = memory returned by retrieval (vector or graph expansion)
    used(m) = retrieved(m) AND injected into active context after gate decisions

Contextual gain is only measured for used memories.

## Influence-Weighted Updates

When contextual gain signals are available, influence factors modulate
reinforcement:

    influence_factor ← (used_count / max(retrieved_count, 1)) ×
                        clamp(contextual_gain(m), −1, +1)
    strength_t ← clamp(strength_{t−1} × exp(−λ_t × Δt) +
                       S × use_frequency_t + F × influence_factor, 0, 1)

## Causal Feedback Loop

The system tracks causal influence of retrieved memories on generation
quality through contextual gain—the semantic alignment (cosine
similarity) between the current signal embedding and the retrieved
memory embedding.

### Focus Feedback

    αF_base = 0.10; βF_base = 0.05
    weight_relevance_t ← weight_relevance
    attention_width_t ← attention_width
    for each used memory m:
        if contextual_gain(m) > 0:
            weight_relevance_t += αF_base × contextual_gain(m)
            attention_width_t *= (1 − βF_base)
        else:
            attention_width_t *= (1 + βF_base)
    # Drift-responsive dilation + restorative pull to prior
    dilation_force ← S × (1 − T) × drift_step_t
    restoring_force ← F × (attention_width_prior − attention_width_t)
    attention_width_t ← attention_width_t + dilation_force + restoring_force
    weight_relevance ← clamp(weight_relevance_t, 0, 1)
    attention_width_t ← clamp(attention_width_t,
                              attention_width_min, attention_width_max)
    attention_width ← attention_width_t

Positive contextual gain narrows attention and boosts relevance
weighting; negative gain widens attention to explore alternatives. The
drift_step_t term is the instantaneous drift signal from
<a href="#sec-structural-metrics" class="quarto-xref">Section 5</a>.

### Sensitivity Feedback

    η_base = 0.10
    weight_novelty_t ← weight_novelty
    for each used memory m:
        novelty_reward ← 1 − sim(m.embedding, recent_context)
        weight_novelty_t += η_base × (novelty_reward ×
                             contextual_gain(m) −
                             redundancy(m, recent_context))
    weight_novelty_t ← clamp(weight_novelty_t, 0, 1)
    weight_novelty ← weight_novelty_t

This rewards novelty that proves useful while penalizing redundant
retrievals.

### Stability Feedback

    γT_base = 0.05
    for each used memory m:
        if contextual_gain(m) > 0:
            stability_t(m) ← stability(m) + γT_base
        else:
            stability_t(m) ← stability(m) × (1 − γT_base)
        stability(m) ← clamp(stability_t(m), 0.0, 2.0)

The mean stability of used memories provides adjustment to the half-life
target:

    adj ← clamp(mean(stability(m_used)) − 1.0, −0.25, +0.25)
    ΔHalfLife_adj_t ← adj

This factor is consumed by the Stability update
(<a href="#sec-stability-update" class="quarto-xref">Section 4.3.2</a>),
avoiding conflicting adjustments between feedback mechanisms.

## Generation Influence Tracking

When generation embeddings are available, influence incorporates output
trajectory:

    Δḡ ← l2_normalize(ḡ_t) − l2_normalize(ḡ_{t−1})
    drift_mag_gen ← ‖Δḡ‖
    drift_contribution(m) ← (drift_mag_gen / 2) ×
                             max(0, cos(m.embedding, l2_normalize(Δḡ)))

Total influence blends contextual gain, generation similarity, and drift
contribution:

    λ₁ = 0.5; λ₂ = 0.4; λ₃ = 0.3
    influence(m) ← λ₁ × contextual_gain(m) +
                    λ₂ × cos(m.embedding, ḡ_t) −
                    λ₃ × drift_contribution(m)

Sustained influence accumulates over a stability-dependent horizon:

    L_sustain(T) = round(lerp(3, 5, T))
    sustained_influence ← EWMA(sustained_influence,
                               influence(m),
                               α = 2 / (L_sustain(T) + 1))

# Advanced Cognitive Processes

This section presents algorithms modeling higher-order cognitive
phenomena: working memory maintenance, metacognitive monitoring,
reconsolidation dynamics, and serial position effects.

## Working Memory Gates

Following Cowan (2001) capacity constraints, working memory maintains a
limited number of active items. Working memory holds coherent memories
as defined in
<a href="#sec-write-pacing" class="quarto-xref">Section 6.4</a>,
preserving the full content and signal sequence:

    base_capacity = round(lerp(5, 3, S) + lerp(−1, 1, F))

This yields a range of approximately 2-6 memories, broadening the 4±1
chunk limit to accommodate task-dependent requirements. High Sensitivity
reduces capacity (faster turnover), while high Focus modulates breadth.

### Active Memory Structure

Each active memory holds a coherent memory with its full content and
metadata:

    memory.content ← concatenated signal blobs
    memory.source_id ← source identifier (e.g., 'user', 'assistant')
    memory.modality ← primary modality ('text', 'audio', 'image')
    memory.blob_ids ← [blob_1, blob_2, ..., blob_n]  # blob refs
    memory.embedding ← e_rep  # representative embedding (@sec-rep-embedding)
    memory.signals ← [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]  # ordered signal embeddings
    memory.metadata ← {n, s_max, s_avg, drift_acc, mem_elapsed,
                       s_emotion_max, s_arousal_avg}

The emotional metrics (s_emotion_max, s_arousal_avg) are accumulated
during memory formation for use by Emotional Consolidation
(<a href="#sec-emotional-consolidation"
class="quarto-xref">Section 8.7</a>).

### Maintenance Cost

Maintenance incurs cognitive cost:

    maintenance_cost_per_memory = lerp(0.05, 0.15, S)
    complexity_penalty = manifold_complexity × lerp(0.5, 1.5, S)

The manifold_complexity is defined as a normalized local variability
proxy (see Appendix B): manifold_complexity ← clamp((1 −
mean_cos_window) / 2, 0, 1).

### Memory-Level Gating

Gating thresholds determine entry and chunking:

    chunking_threshold = lerp(0.7, 0.9, F)
    gate_threshold = lerp(0.1, 0.4, F)
    rehearsal_rate = lerp(0.5, 2.0, S)
    memory_dedication_strength = lerp(0.3, 0.9, T)

Working memory gating evaluates coherent memories at accumulation
boundaries
(<a href="#sec-boundary" class="quarto-xref">Section 6.4.3</a>), not
individual signals:

    on_memory_boundary:
        [α, β, γ] ← normalize([lerp(0.55, 0.70, F),   # window score weight
                            lerp(0.20, 0.35, F),   # task relevance weight
                            lerp(0.10, 0.30, S)])   # novelty-to-WM weight
        memory_benefit ← α × S_window + β × relevance_to_task(μ_acc, task_context) +
                           γ × novelty_to_set(μ_acc, {m.embedding | m ∈ active_memories})
        margin ← memory_benefit − gate_threshold
        k ← |active_memories|
        C ← max(base_capacity, 1)
        p_cap ← 3
        capacity_pressure(k, C) ← 1 + max(0, (k − C) / C)^p_cap
        raw_cost ← (maintenance_cost_per_memory × k + complexity_penalty) ×
                   capacity_pressure(k, C)
        total_cost ← raw_cost / (1 + raw_cost)  # squash to [0, 1)
        accept_memory = (margin ≥ total_cost)

Normative note (MUST): total_cost is normalized to \[0, 1\] to keep
gating on the same score scale as margin. This avoids cold-start or
capacity regimes where costs can exceed 1 and make acceptance
vanishingly rare.

Note that total_cost is computed from existing active memories only (k
is the current count), so k=0 yields no bootstrap penalty. Capacity
pressure activates only when k \> C.

### Chunking at Memory Level

Chunking operates on memory embeddings to merge related content from the
same source:

    similar_memories ← {m ∈ active_memories | cos(m.embedding, memory.e_rep) > chunking_threshold AND
                                  m.source_id == memory.source_id}
    if |similar_memories| > 0:
        merge_into_chunk(similar_memories, memory)

## Metacognitive Monitoring

The system implements feeling-of-knowing (FOK) and tip-of-tongue (TOT)
detection following Hart (1965) framework:

    FOK_threshold = lerp(0.2, 0.5, F)
    TOT_detection = (FOK > lerp(0.5, 0.8, F)) AND
                     (retrieval_strength < lerp(0.4, 0.2, F))

TOT occurs when metacognitive confidence is high but retrieval strength
is low—the characteristic experience of knowing one knows something but
being unable to access it.

Additional metacognitive parameters:

    confidence_decay_rate = lerp(0.01, 0.1, 1 − T)
    unknown_threshold = lerp(0.3, 0.1, F)
    strategy_switch_latency = lerp(500, 100, S)  # ms
    certainty_requirement = lerp(0.6, 0.9, T)
    metacognitive_sensitivity = F × (1 + 0.5 × S)

## Memory Reconsolidation

Following Nader, Schafe, and Le Doux (2000), retrieved memories enter a
labile state permitting modification:

    τ_labile = lerp(30, 300, T)  # seconds
    reconsolidation_gain = lerp(0.2, 0.02, T)
    lability_susceptibility = (1 − T) × (0.5 + 0.5 × S)

During the lability window, memories can drift toward current context:

    drift_magnitude = (1 − T) × S × lability ×
                       contextual_relevance

Reconsolidation effects propagate to semantically related memories with
decay:

    ripple_decay = lerp(0.5, 0.1, T)  # per semantic hop

## Retrieval Competition

Retrieved memories compete through lateral inhibition, modeling
retrieval-induced forgetting (Anderson, Bjork, and Bjork 1994):

    inhibition_radius = lerp(0.5, 0.85, F)
    winners_k = round(lerp(7, 3, F))
    suppression_per_retrieval = lerp(0.1, 0.01, T) ×
                                 (1 − winning_activation)
    recovery_time_RIF = lerp(300, 1800, T)  # seconds

High Focus produces narrow winner-take-all dynamics; low Focus permits
broader activation.

## Predictive Pre-activation

The system pre-activates memories predicted to be relevant based on the
EMA expectation state (`x_pred_ema`) and recent context:

    prediction_horizon = round(lerp(2, 8, F))
    pre_activation_decay = lerp(0.7, 0.3, T)
    prediction_conf_threshold = lerp(0.3, 0.7, F)
    surprise_sensitivity = S × lerp(2.0, 0.5, T)

When predictions fail (high surprise), the system increases the refresh
rate of pre-activation:

    update_rate_on_surprise = lerp(0.2, 0.02, T) × S

## Serial Position Effects

The architecture models primacy, recency, and distinctiveness effects
observed in human memory (Murdock Jr 1962):

    primacy_window = round(lerp(5, 2, F))
    primacy_bonus = lerp(1.2, 2.0, S)
    recency_window = round(lerp(7, 3, F))
    rehearsal_curve_depth = lerp(0.2, 0.6, S)

The von Restorff (isolation) effect enhances memory for distinctive
items (Hunt 1995):

    distinctiveness_threshold = lerp(0.6, 0.8, F)
    von_restorff_multiplier = lerp(1.5, 3.0, S)

Items in the middle region suffer interference:

    interference_zone = positions[primacy_window+1 : −recency_window]
    middle_suppression = lerp(0.8, 0.5, S) × (1 − F)

## Emotional Consolidation

High-emotion events trigger enhanced consolidation, following McGaugh
(2004) findings. As detailed in
<a href="#sec-activity" class="quarto-xref">Section 9.1.1</a>,
consolidation operates on stored memory metadata:

    θ_intensity = lerp(0.6, 0.8, 1 − S)
    θ_arousal = lerp(0.4, 0.2, S)
    # Consolidation uses stored memory emotional metadata
    trigger = (m.metadata.s_emotion_max ≥ θ_intensity) AND
               (m.metadata.s_arousal_avg ≥ θ_arousal)

Flashbulb memories receive extended half-life bonuses based on the
memory’s peak emotional intensity:

    flashbulb_threshold = lerp(0.9, 0.4, S)
    # Half-life bonus uses stored memory emotional peak
    emotional_half_life_bonus = exp(lerp(0, ln(3), S)) ×
                                 (1 + m.metadata.s_emotion_max)

The emotional metrics (s_emotion_max, s_arousal_avg) are accumulated
during memory formation and stored with the memory
(<a href="#sec-accumulator" class="quarto-xref">Section 6.4.1</a>).

    cascade_radius = round(lerp(1, 5, S))
    cascade_decay = lerp(0.7, 0.3, S)

# Consolidation and Graph Integration

The consolidation system transforms episodic memories into semantic
structures through clustering, summarization, and knowledge graph
construction. Memory-level storage
(<a href="#sec-write-pacing" class="quarto-xref">Section 6.4</a>)
ensures each embedding represents a coherent unit.

## Consolidation Triggers

Consolidation operates on stored memory representatives (e_rep from
<a href="#sec-rep-embedding" class="quarto-xref">Section 6.4.6</a>), not
individual signals. It activates under capacity, rate, or temporal
conditions:

    should_consolidate = (memory_count > consolidation_threshold) OR
                          (m_rate < rate_target / 2) OR
                          (elapsed_time > consolidation_interval)

Definitions (knob-derived):

    consolidation_interval(T) = lerp(300, 3600, T)  # seconds (5 min → 1 hour)
    consolidation_threshold(T) = n_ctx(T) × win_score(T)  # memory-count trigger
    merge_threshold(F) = lerp(0.85, 0.95, F)  # similarity required for clustering

The consolidation rate adapts to Stability and Sensitivity (write_rate
tracks memory writes, not signal writes):

    rate_consolidate = (1 / max(consolidation_interval, 1)) ×
                        (0.3 + 0.7T) × (1 − 0.5S)

### Activity-Aware Scheduling

Consolidation runs during idle periods and preempts for retrieval. The
is_accumulating_memory check ensures consolidation doesn’t interrupt
mid-memory accumulation:

    idle_required(T) = round(0.25 × win_rate_s(T))
    idle_for_s = now_s() − to_s(last_retrieval_ts)
    # Consolidation waits for memory completion, not just signal arrival
    should_start = (NOT is_accumulating_memory) AND
                    (retrieval_queue_depth == 0) AND
                    (idle_for_s ≥ idle_required(T))

Consolidation begins only after the current memory has been flushed
(<a href="#sec-boundary" class="quarto-xref">Section 6.4.3</a>) and the
idle period has elapsed. On retrieval events, consolidation pauses,
commits micro-batches, and resumes when idle.

## Consolidation Scoring

Each stored embedding represents a memory representative (e_rep from
<a href="#sec-rep-embedding" class="quarto-xref">Section 6.4.6</a>).
Each memory receives a consolidation score determining merge priority:

    score_consolidate(m) = weight_strength × strength(m) −
                            weight_redundancy × redundancy(m) +
                            weight_connectivity × connectivity(m) +
                            weight_stability × stability(m)

Weights derive from knobs:

    weight_strength = T; weight_redundancy = F; weight_connectivity = S; weight_stability = T

Low-scoring memories are marked for merging.

## Clustering and Summarization

Marked memories cluster via density-based methods (e.g., DBSCAN) or
k-means using embedding similarity:

    cluster_i = {m_j | cos(m_j, μ_i) > merge_threshold}
    μ_i = centroid(cluster_i)

Summary nodes replace clusters:

    summary.embedding = μ_i
    summary.blob = summarize(fetch_blobs(cluster_i))
    summary.metadata.sources = [m.id for m in cluster_i]

## Semantic Extraction

For sufficiently large clusters, semantic extraction identifies labels
and relations:

    extraction_batch_size = round(lerp(8, 32, T))
    min_cluster_size = round(lerp(3, 10, F))
    label_frequency_threshold = round(lerp(5, 15, T))
    extraction_interval = lerp(300, 3600, T)  # 5 min → 1 hour
    max_extractions_per_cycle = round(lerp(20, 5, T))

Extraction uses structured prompting to identify labels/tags (people,
places, organizations, concepts) and relationships (co-occurrence,
implication, contradiction). Labels are stored as surface strings only
(no type/category field).

Label salience is derived from embeddings rather than model guesses:

    e_label = encode(label_text)
    salience(label) = clamp((cos(e_label, summary.embedding) + 1) / 2, 0, 1)

If a label already exists, its stored salience is updated with
`s_max = max(s_max, salience(label))`.

## Knowledge Graph Construction

The graph comprises two node types:

-   **Memory Nodes:** Summarized embeddings from merged clusters
-   **Label Nodes:** Extracted labels/tags derived from content blobs

Edge types capture relationships:

Edge weight convention (MUST): all association weights are normalized to
\[0, 1\]. For cosine-based edges, store weight01 = clamp((cos_sim + 1) /
2, 0, 1).

-   **co_occurs:** Shared context or temporal proximity
-   **implies:** Directional correlation in embedding drift
-   **causes:** Directional correlation in embedding drift
-   **contradicts:** Strong negative similarity or constraint violation
-   **reinforces:** Frequent joint retrieval
-   **derived_from:** Links summaries to source memories
-   **similar_to:** High cosine similarity (soft equivalence)
-   **has_label:** Attaches an extracted label/tag to a node

### Edge Construction

Co-occurrence edges derive from embedding similarity:

    for (m_i, m_j) in cluster.sources:
        cos_sim ← cos(m_i.embedding, m_j.embedding)
        if cos_sim > lerp(0.85, 0.95, F):
            weight01 ← clamp((cos_sim + 1) / 2, 0, 1)
            create_edge(m_i, m_j, 'co_occurs', weight01)

Causal edges derive from temporal drift:

    temporal_order ← sort_by_timestamp(cluster.sources)
    for i in range(len(temporal_order) − 1):
        m_i, m_j ← temporal_order[i], temporal_order[i+1]
        drift_vec ← m_j.embedding − m_i.embedding
        drift_mag ← ‖drift_vec‖
        if drift_mag > lerp(0.15, 0.35, T):
            weight01 ← clamp(drift_mag / 2, 0, 1)  # drift_mag ∈ [0,2] when embeddings are L2-normalized
            create_edge(m_i, m_j, 'causes', weight01)

## Graph-Augmented Retrieval

Retrieval combines vector similarity with graph expansion. The query
vector is the **current accumulator centroid** (μ_acc), L2‑normalized
for vector search, which aggregates the embeddings of the signals
observed so far in the unflushed memory. This makes retrieval responsive
to the evolving thought unit rather than any single micro‑signal.

    # Query and re-rank using current memory centroid
    q ← l2_normalize(μ_acc)  # memory centroid from Section 4.4.1 (cached pre-reset)
    if |memory_stream| == 0:
        return []  # cold-start fallback (no retrieval candidates)
    results_vec ← topK(vector_search(q, k=kNN_size(F)))
    seed_nodes ← [r.id for r in results_vec]
    if |seed_nodes| == 0 OR graph is empty:
        return results_vec  # deterministic fallback, skip expansion
    expanded_nodes ← graph.traverse(seed_nodes, depth=graph_depth(T), min_edge_weight=min_edge_weight(F))
    combined ← union(seed_nodes, expanded_nodes)
    re_ranked ← sort_by(cos(q, embeddings(combined)))  # re-rank by memory centroid
    # Exclude current-unit writes and WM overlaps before returning
    dup_thresh = lerp(0.96, 0.88, F) × (0.98 + 0.02T)
    eligible ← {m ∈ re_ranked | m.created_at < write_exclusion_ts}
    eligible ← {m ∈ eligible | max_{w∈WM} cos(m.embedding, w) < dup_thresh}
    return eligible

Graph expansion uses recursive traversal with depth limits to find
related context that pure vector search might miss. Using the memory
centroid maintains consistency between vector search and graph expansion
results.

# Interrupt Gate and Streaming Integration

The interrupt gate controls when retrieved memories enter active context
during streaming generation. The gate balances novelty value against
disruption cost. The interrupt gate operates on memory-level context,
using centroids (μ_acc) rather than individual signal embeddings for
novelty and relevance computation. All thresholds and gains in this
section are derived from the three knobs (F, S, T); no fixed behavioral
constants are introduced.

## Marginal Utility Computation

Novelty thresholds scale with knobs and refractory state:

    τ_novelty = lerp(0.10, 0.35, F) × (1 − 0.15S) × (1 + 0.3T)
    τ_mu = lerp(0.08, 0.18, F) × (1 − 0.4S) × (1 + 0.4T)
    retrieval_thresh(F) = lerp(0.25, 0.60, F)

Refractory dynamics suppress rapid successive interrupts:

Interrupt state (per stream):

    prev_x is unset on the first signal of a stream; set prev_x ← x_t after processing each signal
    first_step ← (prev_x is unset for this stream)
    if first_step:
        # cold start: do not update drift_accum
        drift_accum ← drift_accum
    else:
        drift_accum ← drift_accum + cosine_dist(x_t, prev_x)  # cumulative drift
    Δ ← drift_accum − drift_at_last_interrupt  # cumulative drift since last interrupt
    τ_refrac = lerp(24, 96, T) × lerp(1.4, 1.0, S)
    k_refrac = lerp(0.20, 0.05, T) × lerp(0.8, 1.2, F)
    M_refrac = 1.0 + k_refrac × exp(−Δ / τ_refrac)

On interrupt: set drift_at_last_interrupt ← drift_accum (resetting Δ to
0 for subsequent signals).

Effective thresholds incorporate refractory pressure:

    τ_novelty_eff = τ_novelty × M_refrac
    τ_mu_eff = τ_mu × M_refrac

## Marginal Utility Score

The marginal utility (MU) of a candidate memory combines five factors.
Context comparisons use memory centroids rather than individual signal
embeddings:

    # Context window contains recent memory centroids, not individual signals
    ctx_window ← recent_memory_centroids  # bounded deque of recent memory centroids (μ_acc)
    q_retrieval ← l2_normalize(μ_acc)  # accumulator centroid query
    included_set ← {embedding(m) | m already injected into the current context window}

Fallback: if included_set is empty, treat redundancy(·, included_set) =
0 and overlap_star = −1.

    if |ctx_window| == 0:
        ctx_centroid ← q_retrieval  # fallback: use current unit centroid
    else:
        ctx_centroid ← mean(ctx_window)  # centroid of recent memory centroids

    weights_mu_raw = [lerp(0.40, 0.60, F),   # coverage gain
             lerp(0.35, 0.25, F),   # relevance
             lerp(0.15, 0.25, S),   # redundancy penalty
             lerp(0.15, 0.25, S),   # incoherence penalty
             lerp(0.20, 0.50, S)]   # surprise bonus
    [weight_cov, weight_rel, weight_red, weight_incoh, weight_surp] = normalize(weights_mu_raw)

    mu = weight_cov × coverage_gain(candidate | included_set) +
          weight_rel × map01(cos(candidate, ctx_centroid)) −
          weight_red × redundancy(candidate, included_set) −
          weight_incoh × (1 − coherence_struct_t) +
          weight_surp × surprisal_t  # surprise bonus

With map01 applied, each MU term is in \[0, 1\], so μ is calibrated to
the same range as τ_mu.

## Gate Decision Logic

Duplicate suppression threshold:

    dup_thresh = lerp(0.96, 0.88, F) × (0.98 + 0.02T)
    K = round(lerp(10, 6, F))  # candidates to evaluate

Higher Focus lowers `dup_thresh`, making duplicate suppression stricter.

### Write Exclusion Filter

Memories stored during the current accumulation unit are excluded from
interrupt consideration to prevent self-triggering. Using the
accumulation start timestamp ensures all memories written within the
current unit are excluded:

    # Exclude memories written during current accumulation to prevent self-triggering
        write_exclusion_ts ← t_start  # start timestamp from Accumulator State section
    candidates_eligible ← {c ∈ candidates | c.created_at < write_exclusion_ts}

This filter is applied before novelty and marginal utility evaluation.
All subsequent gate logic operates on candidates_eligible rather than
the raw candidate set, preventing recursive triggering within a coherent
thought unit.

**Working memory exclusion (normative):** retrieval must also exclude
candidates that overlap with active working‑memory slots. This keeps
“what I just said” in working memory rather than re‑injecting it from
long‑term memory. The exclusion uses the same duplication threshold as
the gate:

    dup_thresh = lerp(0.96, 0.88, F) × (0.98 + 0.02T)
    candidates_eligible ← {c ∈ candidates_eligible | max_{w∈WM} cos(c, w) < dup_thresh}

Boundary-aware override permits lower-threshold interrupts at natural
boundaries:

    boundary_mult = lerp(1.3, 2.0, F) × lerp(1.1, 0.9, S)

The gate permits interrupt when:

    at_drift_boundary = should_flush  # boundary signal from the current accumulator
    if |candidates_eligible| == 0:
        allow_interrupt = false  # cold-start / empty-store fallback
    else:
        candidate_star = argmax_{c ∈ candidates_eligible} mu(c)
        mu_star = mu(candidate_star)
        rel_star = map01(cos(candidate_star, ctx_centroid))
        if |included_set| == 0:
            overlap_star = −1.0
        else:
            overlap_star = max_{y ∈ included_set} cos(candidate_star, y)
        if |ctx_window| == 0:
            novelty_star = 1.0
        else:
            max_cos = max_{c ∈ ctx_window} cos(candidate_star, c)  # in [−1, 1]
            novelty_star = clamp((1 − max_cos) / 2, 0, 1)
        allow_interrupt =
            (rel_star ≥ retrieval_thresh(F)) AND
            (novelty_star ≥ τ_novelty_eff OR mu_star ≥ τ_mu_eff) AND
            (overlap_star < dup_thresh) AND
            (at_drift_boundary OR mu_star ≥ boundary_mult × τ_mu_eff)

This logic suppresses low-drift interrupts unless the marginal utility
substantially exceeds threshold, while permitting normal-threshold
interrupts at natural transition points.

## Streaming Pacing

Streaming retrieval is gated by cumulative drift rate within the
accumulation unit. Retrieval checks trigger when drift exceeds threshold
or at boundaries. Retrieval uses q_retrieval (the accumulator centroid)
captured before any accumulator reset for this step. Retrieval returns a
candidate pool already filtered by write‑exclusion and WM‑overlap rules;
the interrupt gate then applies novelty/utility thresholds and
redundancy penalties.

    # Pacing tracks drift within current memory formation

where cosine_dist(u, v) = 1 − cos(u, v).

    first_step ← (x_last_check is unset for this stream)  # MUST occur once per stream
    if first_step: x_last_check ← x_t; drift_acc_pacing ← 0
    drift_acc_pacing += cosine_dist(x_t, x_last_check)
    pacing_thresh(S) = lerp(0.5, 0.1, S)
    max_wait_drift(F) = lerp(2.0, 0.5, F)
    adjacent_window(F) = round(lerp(8, 1, F))

    since_last_s ← if last_retrieval_ts == 0 then +∞ else (now_ms() − last_retrieval_ts) / 1000
    min_gap_s ← adjacent_window(F) × dt_ema
    adjacent_ok ← (since_last_s ≥ min_gap_s)
    force_check ← (drift_acc_pacing > max_wait_drift(F))

    # Retrieval triggered when drift exceeds threshold, at memory boundary, or when drift exceeds max_wait_drift.
    # Adjacent-window throttling is bypassed on boundaries and force_check.
    if (drift_acc_pacing > pacing_thresh(S) OR should_flush OR force_check) AND
       (adjacent_ok OR should_flush OR force_check):
        trigger_check(); x_last_check ← x_t; drift_acc_pacing ← 0; last_retrieval_ts ← now_ms()

High Sensitivity produces frequent checks triggered by small content
shifts; high Focus enforces strict drift limits. Memory boundaries
(<a href="#sec-boundary" class="quarto-xref">Section 6.4.3</a>) also
trigger retrieval checks to ensure context updates align with natural
thought transitions.

# Experimental Results

We present preliminary experimental results collected from live chat
sessions to validate the adaptive mechanisms.

## Threshold Adaptation

The dynamic threshold (θ_dynamic) successfully tracked score
distributions. In high-volatility inputs (within-accumulator drift_acc
\> 1.0), thresholds relaxed to ~0.15, while stable contexts tightened to
~0.27.

## Boundary Detection

Accumulator drift (drift_acc) aligned with semantic shifts. Conversation
turns with distinct topics triggered flushes (boundary_score \> 0.3)
while coherent continuations remained accumulated.

## Latency and Performance

End-to-end processing per token averaged \< 50ms. Graph expansion added
\< 10ms overhead due to efficient kNN (k=32) and limited expansion depth
(d=2).

# Implementation Considerations

## Computational Complexity

The primary per-stimulus cost is the k-nearest-neighbors (kNN) search
for metrics and retrieval. With `N` stored memories, naive search is
`O(N)`. We recommend maintaining an HNSW index (Malkov and Yashunin
2018) to achieve `O(log N)` retrieval.

Recursive graph expansion adds overhead but is bounded by `depth` and
`branching_factor`, effectively constant-time relative to `N`. Total
complexity per stimulus is `O(log N)` with indexing.

## Memory Footprint

The system stores: \* `signal_stream`: `n_ctx` embeddings (256d float32
= 1KB each). \* `score_stream`: Scalar history. \* `memory_stream`: `N`
stored memories (embedding + metadata). \* `graph`: Adjacency lists for
graph edges.

For long-running instances, `memory_stream` and `graph` dominate.
Pruning low-strength memories
(<a href="#sec-memory-strength" class="quarto-xref">Section 7.1</a>) is
essential for bounding growth.

## Numerical Stability

Exponential decays and probability computations can suffer from
underflow. We use `log-space` arithmetic where appropriate and clamp all
potentially divergent values (e.g., division by small sums) with ε =
10⁻⁶.

# Conclusion and Future Directions

We have presented Cortext, a three-knob adaptive memory architecture
that unifies working, episodic, and semantic memory processes under a
continuous control regime. By deriving most system parameters from
Focus, Sensitivity, and Stability, while fixing a small set of
invariants for controller stability, Cortext avoids the fragility of
hard-coded constants and enables robust operation across diverse
environments.

Key contributions include the formalization of knob-derived parameter
spaces, the integration of uncertainty-weighted Bayesian adaptation, and
the implementation of bio-inspired mechanisms like homeostatic rate
control and emotional consolidation.

Future work will focus on: 1. **Large-scale evaluation:** Validating the
architecture on long-horizon datasets (~1M+ steps). 2. **Multi-agent
dynamics:** Exploring how Cortext instances interact in collaborative
settings. 3. **Hardware acceleration:** Optimizing the kNN and graph
traversal kernels for edge devices.

Cortext represents a step toward more organic, life-long learning
systems that adapt continuously to their experiences, moving beyond
static knowledge bases toward truly cognitive memory.

# Appendix A. State Variables Map

This appendix enumerates the state variables used by the specification
and separates retained state (carried across timesteps) from per-step
derived quantities. The canonical source for section references is
`docs/paper/sections/*.qmd`; anchors in these files are authoritative
when resolving cross-reference drift.

## State + Initialization (Canonical)

On cold start (no persisted state), initialize retained state as follows
(unless otherwise specified by knob priors):

-   **Global defaults:** `signals_processed = 0`, `u_uncertainty = 0`,

-   **Buffers:** `signal_stream`, `score_stream`, `memory_stream`,
    `recent_memory_centroids` start empty.

-   **Retention history:** `retention_history` starts empty (populated
    after the first signal step).

-   **Accumulator state (per stream; retained across timesteps):**

    -   `{μ_acc, drift_acc, s_sum, s_max, n, e_peak, emo_max, arousal_sum, eta_acc, coherence_prev, acc_signals_window, t_start, last_signal_ts, last_write_ts, drift_accum, drift_at_last_interrupt, drift_acc_pacing, x_last_check, prev_x}`

    step):**

    -   `{signal_gap_s, coherence_curr, s_avg, S_window, boundary_score, should_flush, write_memory, Δwrites, q_retrieval}`

# Appendix B. Derived Signals: Definitions and Bounds

This appendix defines non-trivial derived signals used throughout the
specification. Unless otherwise stated, all derived scalars are clamped
to \[0, 1\].

**novelty:** A normalized dissimilarity-to-context signal.

    max_cos ← max_{c ∈ recent_context} cos(x_t, c)  # in [−1, 1]
    novelty_t ← clamp((1 − max_cos) / 2, 0, 1)

Fallback: if recent_context is empty, set novelty_t ← 1.

**μ_sim:** A normalized mean similarity to context.

    mean_cos ← mean_{c ∈ recent_context} cos(x_t, c)
    μ_sim ← clamp((mean_cos + 1) / 2, 0, 1)

Fallback: if recent_context is empty, set μ_sim ← 0.5.

**rarity_t:** A normalized rarity signal defined as
dissimilarity-to-context mean.

    rarity_t ← clamp(1 − μ_sim, 0, 1)

Fallback: inherits μ_sim fallback, so rarity_t defaults to 0.5 when
recent_context is empty.

**relevance_to_task(q, task_ctx):** A normalized relevance of embedding
q to a task context set.

    if |task_ctx| == 0: return 0.5
    return clamp((cos(q, mean(task_ctx)) + 1) / 2, 0, 1)

**novelty_to_set(q, S_set_embeddings):** A normalized novelty of q
relative to a set of embeddings.

    novelty_to_set(q, S_set_embeddings) ← 1 − redundancy(q, S_set_embeddings)

**ΔSSE:** A normalized improvement in reconstruction/prediction error
(utility proxy).

    ΔSSE ← clamp((SSE_prev − SSE_curr) / max(SSE_prev, ε), 0, 1)

Definitions:

    SSE_curr ← ‖x_t − x_pred_t‖^2          # prediction error at t (x_pred_t = x_pred_ema for EMA predictor)
    SSE_prev ← previous SSE_curr (t−1)     # or EWMA if smoothing is used

Fallback: if no prediction model is available, or if dimensions
mismatch, set ΔSSE ← 0.

**redundancy(a, S_set):** A normalized redundancy of item a w.r.t. a set
S_set.

    redundancy(a, S_set) ← max_{s ∈ S_set} clamp((cos(a, s) + 1) / 2, 0, 1)

Fallback: if S_set is empty, redundancy(a, S_set) ← 0.

**coverage_gain(candidate | included_set):** Incremental coverage
contribution of adding candidate.

    coverage_gain(candidate | included_set) ← 1 − redundancy(candidate, included_set)

# Appendix C. Edge Case Rules

These rules resolve empty-store and small-store cases to preserve
causality and avoid undefined metrics.

-   **memory_stream empty:** kNN returns empty; retrieval returns no
    candidates; graph traversal is skipped. Set `focus_spread_t = 0`.
-   **memory_stream small:** use
    `k_eff = min(k_neighbors(T), |memory_stream|)`. If `k_eff < 2`, set
    `focus_spread_t = 0`.
-   **graph absent or empty:** skip graph traversal; use vector search
    only.
-   **recent_context empty:** apply fallbacks defined in Appendix B
    (e.g., `novelty_t = 1`, `μ_sim = 0.5`, `rarity_t = 0.5`,
    `μ_ctx = 0_vector` so `map01(cos)=0.5`).
-   **recent_scores empty:** set `observed_p90 ← θ_prior` in threshold
    updates.

# Appendix D. Main Loop Execution Order and Normative Invariants

This ordering is canonical and supersedes any other sequence described
elsewhere in the document.

Canonical single-step pseudocode (timestep t):

    # Main loop (single timestep t)
    now_s, now_ms, x_t ← read_inputs()
    signal_stream.append(x_t)
    recent_context ← tail(signal_stream, n_ctx(T))

    # Structural metrics + uncertainty
    coherence_struct_t, focus_spread_t, drift_mag_t, surprisal_t ← compute_structural_metrics(x_t)
    x_pred_ema ← update_prediction_ema(x_pred_ema, x_t, T)  # after surprisal_t
    u_t ← update_uncertainty(...)

    # Adaptation + scoring
    update_control_parameters(...)
    score_t ← compute_composite_score(...)
    score_stream.append(score_t)

    # Threshold updates
    θ_target ← prior_evidence_blend(...)
    Δθ_* ← compute_threshold_deltas(...)
    θ_dynamic ← update_theta_dynamic(...)
    hysteresis ← update_hysteresis(...)

    # Accumulator + boundary
    update_accumulator(...)
    boundary_score ← compute_boundary_score(...)
    spike_bypass ← check_spike_bypass(score_t, θ_dynamic, mem_maturity, coherence_t)
    should_flush ← boundary_decision(boundary_score, time_caps, spike_bypass)
    θ_memory ← θ_dynamic × M_write_refrac
    write_memory ← force_write OR (should_flush AND (S_window > θ_memory))
    Δwrites ← 1 if write_memory else 0  # computed immediately after write decision

    # Post-write and retrieval (q_retrieval captured before any reset)
    if write_memory: commit_memory_unit(); last_write_ts ← now_ms()
    q_retrieval ← l2_normalize(μ_acc)  # cache current-unit query
    streaming_pacing_check()
    graph_retrieval(q_retrieval)
    update_rate_state(Δwrites)
    if should_flush: reset_accumulator()  # regardless of write outcome

    # Interrupt gate (consumes retrieved candidates)
    interrupt_gate_check()

The normative execution order for a single timestep t:

1.  **Read Inputs:** `x_t`, `now_s()`, `system_time_ms`.
2.  **Update Buffers:** Append `x_t` to `signal_stream`. Update
    `n_ctx(T)`. Retrieve `recent_context`.
3.  **Compute Structural Metrics:** `coherence_struct`, `focus_spread`,
    `drift`, `surprisal`, then update `x_pred_ema` for the next step.
4.  **Update Uncertainty:** `u(t)`.
5.  **Compute Adaptation Dynamics:**
    -   Update `α_F(t)`, `α_T(t)`.
    -   Update `weight_relevance`, `half_life`.
    -   Update `emotion` and `mood` state.
6.  **Compute Composite Score:**
    -   Compute all 12 metrics.
    -   Update RLS weights `W_blend`.
    -   Compute `score_t`. Append to `score_stream`.
7.  **Update Thresholds:**
    -   Compute `θ_target` (prior/evidence).
    -   Compute `Δθ` terms (homeo, sens, prec, emo, mood).
    -   Update `θ_dynamic`. Update `hysteresis`.
8.  **Execute Memory Accumulation:**
    -   Update accumulator (`drift_acc`, `s_max`, etc.).
    -   Compute `boundary_score` and `should_flush`.
    -   Check `spike_bypass` using the effective spike margin scaled by
        `mem_maturity` and `coherence_t`.
    -   Compute `S_window` and `θ_memory`.
    -   Decide `write_memory`.
9.  **Post-Write Updates and Retrieval:**
    -   If `write_memory`: Write to `memory_stream`. Update
        `last_write_ts`.
    -   Cache `q_retrieval ← μ_acc` before any accumulator reset.
    -   Run streaming pacing and retrieval using `q_retrieval`.
    -   Update `rate_state` (homeostatic controller).
    -   If `should_flush` (regardless of write): Call
        `reset_accumulator()`.
10. **Run Interrupt Gate:** Check for streaming interrupt using
    retrieved candidates (already filtered by write‑exclusion and WM
    overlap during retrieval).

Timing notes: \* `now_s()` is captured at step 1 and reused for all Δt
computations in this timestep. \* Threshold updates in step 7 use the
score computed in step 6. \* Rate updates in step 9 use Δwrites from the
current step’s `write_memory` decision.

**Normative Invariants:** \* **Causality:** Step `k` uses only values
computed in steps `1` through `k` or retained from `t-1`. \* **Write
Atomicity:** A “write” is an atomic commit of a `should_flush` unit.
Partial units are never written. \* **Gap Consistency:** `now_s()` is
fixed at step 1. All `Δt` calculations use this fixed value.
